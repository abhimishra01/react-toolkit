#### React Toolkit

- My personal react-toolkit / boiler plate code
- Built on top of create-react-app boilerplate

### Problem statement

- I had to re configure the create-react-app boilerplate, by adding additional configurations, dependencies, etc required for project development.
- Hence, I came up with the need to configure a template of my own through which I can easily start working with the development instead of configuring the application from scratch.
- I would love to see others fork, clone, use this toolkit as in their projects.
- Let me know what you think about this react-toolkit.
